            <p className='paragraph'>
              I’ve been thinking about my mission statement from about the time I was in sixth grade,
              seriously. <span className="ital">What am I about and what do I want to be when I grow up?</span>
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              I’d like to share my vision for <span className="ital">eaglefire productions</span>. Individually and collectively, I am
              committed to creating lasting stories across multiple genres. My sincerest hope is that, <span className="ital">
                if only for a moment</span>, the stories emotionally, humorously and thoughtfully impact people’s lives. I am
              deeply committed to all the above. The <span className="ital">eaglefire</span> dream keeps me awake at night...
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              And please, bear with me a moment because I’ve had this particular thought, this singular idea,
              <span className="ital"> this thing</span> in my brain for years. In a good way, I’m almost haunted by it—the idea is an
              <span className="ital">interactive</span> production company. Honestly, I still don’t know exactly what that means. But it has
              to do with involving artists and thinkers and dreamers who want to create and build
              something...<span className="ital">together</span>.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              I envision a kind of launch pad for others work: books, short stories, short films, poems, songs,
              artwork, photographs, etc. It’s about showcasing others work for those, like me, who never had
              contacts or knew the right people...or were just a bit unlucky. The goal would be to develop
              enough momentum that agents and publishers and producers might come here to find new talent.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              More specifically, my heart goes out to those artists, like me, who have been working and
              creating for a decade or two (or three) and have been discouraged thus far by the lack of access.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              A <span className="ital">community</span> production company..? I don’t know exactly how to do this but am committed and
              compelled to find a way for others to feel more personally invested in not only my work, but the
              work of others—a shared experience. The logistics might look challenging, but right now and
              forever it’s about the possibilities...the <span className="ital">What if...?</span> And the <span className="ital">Why not...?</span>
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              If you build it...<span className="ital">they will come</span>. Maybe I can build something that others will find...maybe we
              can build that together. As for me, I’m done with failure—totally over it. To that, my mission is
              clear, attract a top agency, publisher and producer... because <span className="ital">the readiness is all</span>.
            </p>
            <strong className='ital' style={{'color': 'rgb(188, 147, 22)'}}>author brand</strong>
            <p className="paragraph">
              I’ve read about, thought about, spoken to experts about and seriously wrestled with this idea of
              an author’s brand. For practical reasons, for developing an audience of readers, I like the idea of
              it—a singular brand so that the audience knows <span className="ital">who and what</span> they will get when they buy one
              of my books. It’s common for most authors to write within one genre of books—and thus offer
              one brand.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              The challenge for me is I write across multiple genres so, by definition, I don’t quite fit into the
              singular brand structure. Of course, I’m hopeful I can reach a broader audience, but the fact is
              most of us have our story/genre preferences. Some might read only literary works, others might
              prefer the middle-grade/young adult fantasy-adventure series and still others might quite like the
              off-centered humor of a comedy-adventure series. My books, my genres, are all of the
              above...<span className="ital">How do I brand that?</span>
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              So, I’ve decided to make my production company my brand—the <span className="ital">eaglefire</span> brand—which
              includes multiple genres and a multi-sphere of possibilities. I understand <span className="ital">eaglefire</span> as a brand is
              uncommon and perhaps a harder sell—but it’s true to my work and experience. It’s what I hope
              to provide. Interestingly, I’ve read that having more than one primary writing style or genre will
              only dilute or weaken the brand. Funny, because I would think it’s just the opposite.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              Please know, this isn’t some sort of <span className="ital">I’m special</span> kind of baloney—far from it. It’s just that the
              conventional branding structure and logistics don’t seem to mesh. I can’t, nor would I limit
              myself to one genre—I wouldn’t even know how to do that. Because I have no idea where the
              stories come from, none whatsoever. I answer to the stories...the stories don’t answer to me.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              For this, and for everything related to me, my books and production company, I’m wide open
              and wanting to hear from you and what you think about, well, anything. Please feel free to
              contact me and share your thoughts. <span className="ital">Thank you...</span>
