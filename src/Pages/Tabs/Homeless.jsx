          This won’t make sense to most people, not at all.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          As always, I don’t like revealing all of this about myself and please don’t imagine this is some
          sort of sad song, it’s not—it was yet another example of the Universe working its magic. But I
          think some context is needed to help explain how a well-educated, hard-working guy from a
          mostly middle-class upbringing, ended up sleeping in his car for four months while living in a
          homeless lot. 
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I went through a five or six year period when I chose to work in restaurants waiting tables
          because I had to keep my days free to write. Those years, without comparison, were the worst
          years of my life. I’m not built for waiting tables, it goes against all my natural instincts. It sucked
          the soul energy right out of me and reduced me to nothing. With each passing month that turned
          to years, I lost sight of myself, I was dead man walking. And I can’t overstate this, I don’t think
          or feel the word hate, it’s just not me.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          And yet, I hated waiting tables...<span className="ital">I hated it.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I learned a long time ago that I can’t do the 9-5 job and then come home to write. I don’t have
          the required energy and focus needed for writing after working all day somewhere else. For me,
          writing books demands and takes <span className="ital">everything</span>. So, waiting tables was the only way I could wake
          up in the morning and sit down to do the work with a fresh mind.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Years prior, I recall waiting tables in New York City when I was trying to break in as an actor.
          Back then, we were all mostly twenty-somethings trying to break into acting, dancing, directing
          or singing. There was a guy in his forties who worked with us, a really nice guy who everyone
          liked. He had the first signs of gray hair and was an actor who had been there a long time. I
          remember thinking I would never be waiting tables in my 40’s—I wondered how his self-esteem
          survived. So, naturally, all these years later, I became the guy waiting tables in my 40’s.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          By the time my homeless experience began, I was at the end of my rope. To say I was at the end
          of my rope is a cute little phrase that doesn’t begin to capture the depths of my depression during
          those years. I was at the end of it all, of everything. The darkness had overtaken me, consumed
          me—it was scary bad. I needed to get out, for my mental and emotional well-being—I had to get
          out. The severe depression had started to alter my mind, my thought process and decision
          making. I had succumbed to and believed that I would never achieve my dreams, never be able
          to afford a normal life. These were the Florida years when, at times, I lived mostly on coffee and
          cigarettes. But writing...always writing.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I love California, I went to college out there and have been trying to get back all my life. And
          what I did that day, what I chose to do wasn’t logical, wasn’t in any way clear-thinking or
          rational. But when you’re at the end, nothing matters and anything looks better than where you
          are. I could have stayed in Florida, the place I was living and continued waiting tables but no,
          just... <span className="ital">no</span>. I had become afraid of the dark thoughts living in my mind and had to get out.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          So, I just got in my car and headed West, my sights set on California. No plan. No contacts. No
          money. Nothing. I slept in rest stops. I lived on coffee and protein bars. When I neared the
          Pacific coast, I just kept driving, straight to the beach. It was late afternoon, the California sun
          shone sweet and welcoming, I sat on the beach an hour or so with no plan and four or five
          hundred dollars to my name.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I could have borrowed some money from family or friends, driven back to Florida and continued
          waiting tables but no, no way, there had to be a better option...a better <span className="ital">anything</span>.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I felt oddly hopeful, that I would somehow make this work. But I didn’t know anyone out there,
          not a soul. Having no plan and utterly without options can be a strangely peaceful feeling
          because you have to let go of any conventional ideas of reality—you just let go. I felt almost
          calm and trusting in a situation that was, at minimum, rather challenging.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          And I certainly wouldn’t recommend this to anyone, but I think momentary lapses of reason are
          all a part of the journey—at least for me. I bought a burrito somewhere near the beach, got back
          into my car and headed North on Highway 5 until I saw the first rest stop and pulled over to
          sleep in my car for the night.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Before leaving Florida, I had run an ad on Craigslist in Southern California offering that I was a
          former general contractor and would be happy to fix something, build something or maybe do a
          work trade for a room to rent. Never mind that I didn’t have any tools or a truck. No one had
          responded that week driving across country, but when I woke up in the car that next morning at a
          rest stop an hour South of LA—someone had responded. She included her phone number, which
          isn’t common in the Craigslist world, and I called her. She asked if I might like to meet her for
          lunch somewhere. I said I would be happy to.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I met her around noon and I’ll never forget how calm she was, as if my situation was familiar to
          her. She asked where I slept the night before, I told her the truth. And then she offered that she
          didn’t have any construction work for me and didn’t have a room for rent—but she had a
          suggestion that she thought might be helpful. She told me of a lot where you can safely park and
          sleep in your car. She said it was for people who have a car but nowhere to go, nowhere to live.
          She told me they provided a few meals each week and that the lot had been around for years.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I sat there a moment, thinking how odd it all was, that my life had arrived at a point where a total
          stranger would suggest a homeless lot. I was appreciative of her time. She was kind and clearly
          wanted to help in some way. But more than that, she knew I was in a tough spot and without
          financial resources. She was calm and cool. She gave me the phone number of the lady who runs
          the lot.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          We walked out to our cars and I watched her drive away—I never heard from her again—like an
          angel who swooped in to save me. I sat there in my car a while, hesitating, and thinking...
          <span className="ital">has itcome to this?</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          And then I called the lady at the lot because yes, <span className="ital">it had come to this.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The woman at the lot answered the call and I told her briefly about my situation, that I had no
          money, no friends in the area and needed somewhere safe to sleep. She said I was welcome to
          stay in the lot as long as I needed until I got my feet back on the ground.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I remember driving over to the lot and thinking it might be an adventure that would someday
          inspire a new book—<span className="ital">it did.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I pulled into the lot and approached the welcome table. Just like the woman who I’d had lunch
          with earlier, this woman was calm and cool. She also struck me immediately as being strong,
          internally strong. It was a church parking lot and she said that several groups offer a few free
          meals each week. The rules were clear, respect everyone, out by six sharp each morning and the
          gate is locked at nine every night.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Almost immediately, I thought of it all in positive terms—maybe depression and survival does
          that. But I had to make that positive shift into the artist possibilities so that my spirit relaxed into
          it, as opposed to being desperate and homeless. I guess in my briefly delusional mind, I thought I
          would only need to be there a few nights, a week or two at the most—just until I found a job and
          room for rent. But I had no money and no job. It was silly to imagine I would be situated
          somewhere else within a week or two. I stayed there, sleeping in the backseat of my car—four
          months.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It was tight in the back seat, very tight and very uncomfortable. The lot was backed up to a major
          interstate—cars, trucks, motorcycles—night and day. But it provided a ‘natural’ alarm clock as
          the commuting traffic picked up loudly around five in the morning. It took a week to figure out
          how to make it all work, how to maximize my limited comfort and I had to learn how to sleep all
          over again.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The lot, the experience had a quietly desperate kind of vibe. People kept to themselves, speaking
          in low tones, heads down. Sometimes at dinner I might share a word or two with someone, but
          no real conversations—survival isn’t social. People came and went, some for only a night or two,
          some for a few days and then there were the regulars, people who had been there for many
          months and had come to know the lot as their home—I became one of the regulars.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          As one can imagine, it was a very private experience and no one was happy to be there. But
          somehow, in the strangest most inexplicable way... <span className="ital">I felt okay.</span> The feeling, deeply within, was
          that I was being guided in some way. Occasionally, I said hello to a couple of the regulars but
          otherwise I had no real conversations with anyone other than the woman who ran the lot. She and
          I became friends and I was glad to know her.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I hated the thought of waiting tables again, but I had to start making money as soon as possible. I
          must have dropped my waiter resume at more than thirty restaurants in and around town, and
          sent it online to many more. For gas and food money, I found a part-time job delivering lunches
          to businesses. California is expensive, very expensive, and my part-time job wasn’t going to
          afford me rent anywhere, not even a room for rent. I was eating, but I was running out of time to
          make it all work.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Funny to say, and most might not believe me, but the Florida waiting tables years were much
          worse an experience than my four months sleeping in my car, in a homeless lot. I was happy to
          be back in California and felt confident that something, anything, would come around and allow
          me to transition back into a more normal life and living situation.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I signed up at the local YMCA so I could continue working out and, more importantly, had a
          place to shower every morning. By the time I left the lot, I was in good shape again. The lot
          offered fruit and bottles of water on the nights there were no meals. It wasn’t bad, I mean, it was
          horrible sleeping in my car, just horrible—but it wasn’t bad.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Every morning, when I climbed out of my backseat, it would take four or five minutes to get the
          blood flowing properly through my legs and more specifically, my knees. I limped over to the
          lot’s public bathroom and by the time I got back, I was mostly walking normally again. But
          somewhere around three months, the pain in my knees became worse and I knew I wouldn’t be
          able to do this much longer—afraid there might be some permanent damage from being so
          cramped and jammed up in the backseat every night.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I ended up finding a guy who was renting a 1960’s camper trailer that I lived in for a couple of
          months. Years ago, someone had backed the trailer into the corner of a lot somewhere and over
          the years, houses and a neighborhood were built around it. It was tiny, like lower your head when
          you walk in tiny. It had a bed so small that my feet hung out at the end, but it was a bed with a
          roof—I’ve never slept better. Every night I climbed into bed with my feet hanging out, I was so
          grateful.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          But I just couldn’t make it work financially, so I had to drive back to Florida.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          A year or so later, I had this <span className="ital">feeling</span> about an Angel who had forgotten how to fly and was living
          in a homeless lot...
