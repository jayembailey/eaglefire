          Following your bliss offers no guarantees in life...but here I go again.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I had a major stroke five years ago and nearly died. In fact, statistically, I had a better chance of
          dying than living. Needless to say, it changed my life.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          When I finally sat down to write this, I thought it would be a page or so. I had no idea what was
          going to happen, what it would open up, what it would reveal, namely...<span className="ital">me</span>.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It’s not an honesty issue, it’s just that I’m a private man and this goes against all my natural
          instincts. I’ve avoided building a website and social media for years because I don’t like feeling
          exposed. And I get the irony, I’m a writer and actor which by definition hangs me out in every
          way—totally exposed. But this is different. There’s no story or play to hide behind...it’s just me.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          One of the worst things anyone could do to me is embarrass me, especially publicly. And it feels
          like I’m setting myself up for embarrassment here. Like, <span className="ital">Who is this guy?</span> Who does he think he
          is? His books aren’t published. He doesn’t even have an agent! He hasn’t acted in twenty years..?
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I’m told by social media coaches that revealing yourself, sincerely and honestly, is a way to more
          authentically build brand. What I’m wanting to build here at <span className="ital">eaglefire</span> is something I still don’t
          quite have the words for. It’s been with me for years, way out there on the peripheral edge, just
          waiting...this idea of what <span className="ital">eaglefire</span> could be. And although it’s still revealing itself, building a
          community of artists, thinkers and dreamers has to begin with sincerity and honesty. So, I’m just
          going to let it fly...
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I’ve failed my entire life.<br/>
          I’ve failed in my personal relationships.<br/>
          I’ve failed to be the man I set out to be.<br/>
          I’ve failed to break into the business of writing and acting.<br/>
          I’ve failed to love myself...and to forgive myself.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">And here’s the cool thing,</span> those failures have been exactly what I needed to get here, today...and
          I’m grateful for it all. Grateful for the heartbreaks and setbacks, grateful for the crippling
          depressions and obliterated self-esteem, grateful for the years of being broke and just surviving,
          grateful for the mind-numbing jobs.... I’m grateful for all of it.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I’ve been at this artist thing since college—almost three decades. I’ve worked so many types of
          jobs, menial and otherwise, waiting tables, hosting, temping, construction, pizza delivery and so
          many other odd jobs I’ve lost count.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          As an undergrad at UCSC, I was initially a poly-sci major and was doing a radio internship with
          the NPR affiliate, KUSP, in Santa Cruz. Writing for the school paper, I had plans to be a
          broadcast journalist. I met the local TV station director to inquire about an internship and he
          suggested I take an acting class so that I might feel more comfortable in front of people.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
        I did...and I never looked back.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I changed my major to literature and theater. I still remember the thrill of all the acting classes,
          scene studies, monologues and full production plays. I was hooked, deeply. I flew out to NYC
          the summer before my senior year to study acting professionally at Playwrights Horizons. And
          when I returned for my senior year, it was as if my soul woke up and said, <span className="ital">
          Yep...this is it. You’re a writer and an actor. So hang on, kid, it’s gonna be a bumpy ride!</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          After graduating, I moved back out to NYC and jumped back into all the acting classes and
          private coaches I could afford. My first published short story, <span className="ital">Michigan Spring,</span> was nominated
          for a Pushcart Prize. Everything pertaining to writing and acting looked good, looked promising—it
          was real and not some sort of delusional dream. I was primed and ready to become a
          professional writer and actor, all I needed was an agent...
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Many of us writer/actor types know how the rest goes...I couldn’t find an agent.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          You get kicked down long enough, you either quit, or you get clear. I chose clear. Because here’s
          the thing... the work, the art of it doesn’t care. It’s just the work doing what it does. The work
          doesn’t care about what I want or when I want it. Do it or don’t. Fail and quit...or choose to be
          better because of the failures. I chose better.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          What’s potentially clarifying about failure is it forces you, time and time again, to
          reconsider. And in my heart, then and now... there is nothing to reconsider. I’m all in and failure
          is not an option. Regardless of how long the road, regardless of how dark the winter—there
          comes the spring. Acceptance isn’t about accepting failure, it’s about accepting that this is the
          road <span className="ital">I chose</span>—and would choose again.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          At some point, I crossed the artist Rubicon, there’s no turning back, fully committed, regardless
          of the outcome. To that, I remain steadfast in my efforts.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          From the time I was in college—I’ve followed my gut. I understood from day one it wasn’t about
          <span className="ital"> me.</span> It’s one of the reasons I trusted my instincts pursuing both writing and acting—because I had
          my head on straight. It wasn’t about me being a movie star or best-selling author, it was about
          having the privilege to do the work.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          They say everything happens for a reason...I let go of <span className="ital">knowing</span> anything a long time ago.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I imagine to some, starting a production company without investors and with nothing but
          unpublished books may seem silly. But I can live with that, I can live with appearing foolhardy.
          What I can’t live with is not giving it my all, each and every time, year after year, decade after
          decade. I keep writing. I keep believing because...<span className="ital">I don’t know how not to.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          And so, here I am...and here I go again.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">Hang on, kid, it’s gonna be a bumpy ride...</span>
