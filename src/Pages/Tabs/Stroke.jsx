        <p className="paragraph">
          I had a major stroke about five years ago and nearly died. In fact, statistically, I had a better
          chance of dying than living—or being irreparably paralyzed. I will never forget any of it, not one
          single moment of it—except everything I can’t remember. What I can’t remember is a testament
          to the mind’s inability to comprehend what is incomprehensible, namely...<span className="ital">dying.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I was working in yet another restaurant, it was slow so I was standing up front chatting with the
          hostess. I needed to do something or other, some waiter task, so I turned to walk away but when I
          set my left foot down there was nothing there...nothing. There was a little half-wall in front of
          me that I grabbed so as to avoid falling to the floor.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It’s true what they say, everything starts to slow down...
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I pulled myself back up and turned again to walk. My right leg was fine, normal, but when my
          left leg tried to move, tried to walk, there was nothing. I was falling again and caught myself on
          the opposite side half-wall. But this time, I was hanging off the wall and slipping to the floor
          because my left arm was becoming useless. My mind spun within an echoing emptiness, a place
          without reference...<span className="ital">what’s happening to me?</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Someone, the hostess I think, quickly slid a chair under me and I fell into the chair as everything
          started to go off-line and shut-down on the left side of my body, including my face. The left side
          of my face started to collapse and sag—the facial muscles were gone and gravity was literally
          pulling my face down.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It's hard to quantify any of this dying business as lucky, but there were several critically
          important moments that were, in fact, life savingly lucky—here is luck’s first instance. There
          happened to be a nurse in the restaurant. She just happened to be sitting at the table closest to
          where I had collapsed. Based on my sagging face and inability to walk, she knew exactly what
          was happening as she stood, walked over and said with a very serious tone, I can still hear her
          say this... <span className="ital">If you want to save his life, call an ambulance now.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">...time slipping</span>...sounds of concerned voices, someone suggested ice under my armpits. This
          was the first moment I realized how helpless I was. Two bags of ice were being handed or
          offered to me. Somebody held the bag of ice under my right armpit, I can feel still that cold
          sensation—but my left side felt nothing. I had to hold the bag of ice under my left armpit with
          my right hand. I kept pressing it harder under my left armpit, not understanding why I couldn’t
          feel the cold ice.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">time slipping</span> ...the paralysis starts to take over... and then I heard sirens. The ambulance’s
          arrival felt immediate, it must have taken at least five or so minutes, but it felt like seconds. This
          is the second instance of luck—the ambulance had been nearby and arrived almost immediately.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          When you’re having a major stroke, your brain is being choked off from oxygenated blood,
          you’re starting to die and your hospital arrival is of utmost importance—life or death importance.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I was increasingly removed from the situation, suspended in disbelief and unable to comprehend
          what was happening. But I remember hearing the sirens drawing near, it’s strange to say but they
          sounded so <span className="ital">real</span>, as if there were no other sounds in the world but the sirens, wailing for me.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Looking around at the confused and scared faces of those standing by, I vaguely recall
          thinking...someone’s in trouble. It was me. I was in trouble. My brain wasn’t functioning
          properly. I wasn’t thinking clearly. Each moment worsened the condition as less and less blood
          flowed to my brain.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          But just a few minutes ago I was chatting with the hostess...<span className="ital">what’s happening to me?</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          And then, quite suddenly, as if from nowhere, the paramedics were next to me, gently lifting me
          up out of the chair, onto the stretcher and rolling me outside in what felt like one, singular
          motion—like I was floating. The ambulance lights, harshly flashing, rolling, incongruously
          reflecting off the nearby walls, heightening the emergency aspect as people stood around and
          watched me wheeled over and slid into the back of the big, red truck. So surreal—something that
          couldn’t be happening was happening...<span className="ital">to me.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          You have two carotid arteries, traveling up the left and right side of your neck, the primary
          avenues for oxygenated blood flowing to the brain. One of my arteries was torn, the blood had
          gathered to protect the tear which caused a major blood clot.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">time slipping</span>...and then I’m staring at the ambulance ceiling as the big, red truck accelerates
          fast—lights and sirens blazing. They drive especially fast when the patient is literally dying in
          front of them. I remember feeling or hearing the power of the speeding truck. I remember the
          odd medical equipment smell. I can’t recall his face, but the paramedic hooked me up to various
          things, took my vitals and then was on a direct line to the hospital when I heard him say <span className="ital">stroke victim...</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          That was the first time I heard the word stroke. No one in my world has had a stroke. I had no
          real idea what a stroke was but I could not move the left side of my body, at all. The paramedic
          asked me, calm and collected, Mr. Pflueger, can you move your left leg or arm for me? <span className="ital">No, Isaid.
          </span> Okay, can you move your fingers or toes? <span className="ital">No, I said.</span> Okay, can you feel that? Presumably
          pricking my toes or fingers. <span className="ital">No, I said.</span> And with each response of <span className="ital">No,</span> I began to feel a frightful
          emptiness that I never before imagined. The left side of my body wasn’t working. My
          pronunciation of the word <span className="ital">No</span> didn’t sound right, didn’t sound like me—the entire left side of my
          body was completely paralyzed.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">Okay</span>, the paramedic said, <span className="ital">
          We’re just a few minutes from the hospital, they’ll take very good care
          of you.</span> I mean, he has to say that, right? That’s just what they say? Then he said, 
          <span className="ital">You’re very lucky they called us so quickly and we happened to be nearby</span>. We didn’t speak again or I don’t
          remember speaking. Something was terribly wrong, so terribly, terribly wrong...
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">They can fix this... right?</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I wasn’t feeling a common nervousness or even fear, it was deeper than that...it was the mind
          returning from its place of total detachment and just now starting to grasp that the situation is life
          and death. My life—my death. I read it in the paramedic’s eyes. He was professional and
          calm...but the eyes don’t lie.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">They can fix this... right?</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I didn’t know it then of course, but right here is where Tommy’s space ambulance was born as he
          was on route through deepest space to the Dream Memorial Hospital. 
          <span className="ital"> (Daisy and The Dream Defenders)</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I was on route to the Sarasota Memorial Hospital, one of the finest stroke hospitals in the
          country. There was another less reputable hospital closer to where I had collapsed and would
          have been taken there had the nurse or someone not insisted that I be taken to the Sarasota
          hospital. (the third instance of luck)
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          When the ambulance pulled into the ER arrivals area, there was a doctor standing outside waiting
          for me, one of Florida’s most progressive and expert stroke doctors who 
          <span className="ital"> just happened to be in town and on shift that day.</span> (the fourth instance of luck, and combined with the prior three
          instances, no doubt, collectively saved my life) The moment the paramedics had my cot down
          and rolling, the doctor was leaning over me with one hand on the cot and talking as they wheeled
          me in. I couldn’t quite hold his eyes, I was slipping away—but trying so hard to hear him.
          Everything felt blurry. Nothing seemed right, off-center and tilted.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          When your brain starts to die, so do you—it’s a package deal.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I remember how very serious the doctor’s facial expression was, I remember his tone of voice.
          He had only minutes to communicate what was happening to me—and what my <span className="ital">only</span> option was.
          I heard him speaking, but only in phrases or partial sentences.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          As we rolled inside and down a hallway I heard 
          <span className="ital">major stroke...brain dying... one
          option...experimental drug...unblock the blood clot...have to break up the clot... potential side
          effects...brain swelling... death... need your permission...need your permission to administer the
          drug...only option...do I have your permission..? Do I have your permission?</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The situation was so dire that I literally had only one option to save my life—and it wasn’t a
          good one. The drugs success rate wasn’t good—a 35 to 40 percent success rate. Brain swelling
          and death didn’t sound good but I was completely paralyzed and dying anyway, so I couldn’t say
          yes fast enough. <span className="ital">Yes...now...yes...now</span>. I had just said yes to a drug that was statistically more
          likely to fail than succeed, a drug that could kill me. And if it didn’t work, that would be the
          end...
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I remember hearing myself try to talk, my jaw and mouth didn’t work right, I sounded like I was
          talking with hardening concrete in my mouth.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">time slipping again</span>...in a strange room with a huge machine that was taking a picture of my
          brain and neck...in my ER room now, filled with doctors and nurses, hooking me up to
          machines.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          And then it occurred to me. If the drug didn’t work, I had only minutes before I would be
          unconscious. And I might never wake up again, or wake up to a life so reduced I would have
          wished I never woke up. I remember trying to hold on, hold on to still being there, being <span className="ital">here</span>, as
          if I might will myself...
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <span className="ital">Stay alive...stay alive.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Your brain is not getting the oxygenated blood it needs to live—so you slowly go off-line, maybe
          forever. And there is nothing you can do about it. Nothing. Your life, your entire life, is in
          someone else’s hands now—it redefined the word helpless. It wasn’t that I chose to let go, it was
          that letting go was all I could do. And if the drug didn’t work...I would die or be helplessly
          paralyzed for the rest of my life.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Often, emergency cardiovascular surgery is what’s done in these situations. The surgeon enters
          the artery near the groin area and guides a camera tube all the way up your body and into your
          neck in hopes of breaking up the blood clot—allowing blood to flow again. But the
          cardiovascular surgeon later said the blood clot was so dangerously close to the base of my brain
          that surgery would have just as likely killed me than saved me.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I was in such bad shape that by the time they would have had me prepped for surgery and
          performed the surgery, too much time would have elapsed—and I was already out of time.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          So it was the experimental drug...or <span className="ital">nothingness</span>.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          They administered the drug immediately as I stared at the IV bag. It felt like controlled chaos. I
          felt warm, at least on the right side of my body. Everything moved slowly. At some point, I
          noticed a doctor and nurse standing at the foot of my bed, the nurse held a clipboard clutched to
          her chest, the doctor had his hands in his white coat, they weren’t doing anything, just standing
          there, watching me live or die—waiting to see if the drug worked.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I’m right-handed. Amidst all the hustle and bustle in my room, amidst all the tubes and wires I
          was hooked up to, amidst my being paralyzed and my slow-motion dying...I <span className="ital">yawned</span>. For no
          earthly reason...I yawned. But instead of lifting my right hand to cover my mouth as I normally
          would...I lifted my left. <span className="ital">I lifted my left hand</span>. I was slowly starting to come back online as the
          clot began to break up and blood started flowing into my brain again.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          And then, in tandem at the foot of my bed, both the doctor and nurse made a sound, a sound I
          will never forget because it was the singular and universal sound people make when a toddler
          takes their first step. That sound, that exclamation is the same the world over... a mix of elevated
          surprise and joy. For a moment, I didn’t know why they were making that sound, and then my
          brain caught up, I had raised my <span className="ital">left hand</span> as I yawned. And then I got it. They were anticipating
          my death...and then they watched me come back on-line, back to life. Thus, the expressions and
          sounds they made, together. I can still hear them.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Later that night, recovering in the hospital room, I sort of woke up from a sleep that wasn’t sleep.
          It was very late. The nurse checked on me and adjusted various tubes and wires. I’d been sort of
          dreaming. For most of my life I haven’t been able to remember my dreams—that’s still true. She
          attached a vial to a little hose in my hand and took more blood. And as I watched the blood flow
          out I had the distinct feeling of it all being... <span className="ital">a dream within a dream.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Death is abstract, until it’s not...and then is abstract again.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          A year or so later, that <span className="ital">dream within a dream</span> became what Tommy experienced in the Dream
          Memorial Hospital. <span className="ital">(Daisy and The Dream Defenders)</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I was in intensive care for three days—three days of twenty-four hour and constant attention. I
          was still very vulnerable, my carotid artery was healing. I had tubes and wires and screens
          attached to me and a constant beeping that registered my vitals around the clock. It felt, I felt,
          robotic. The computer monitored me and automatically checked my blood pressure every twenty
          or thirty minutes—around the clock. Blood pressure for a recovering stroke patient is critically
          important. The blood pressure balloon thing on my arm would fill with air and squeeze my arm
          every twenty minutes, day and night, all night long.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I didn’t sleep much—but I remember the first time I was able to reach over with my left hand
          and grab the bed’s metal side bars to adjust myself in the bedding. The nurse was standing there
          and I said, <span className="ital">Wow, I can do that now</span>. But I was afraid to close my eyes, for months and months I
          was afraid to close my eyes, wondering if they would never open again.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          And then another three or four days in a ‘normal’ hospital room. I had my own room, which was
          nice because I didn’t feel like being social. It’s like, what’s there to small talk about? What would
          I say to the person next to me? 
          <span className="ital">So, I almost died... how’re things with you? Yeah, nice weatherwe’re having.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I’ve always been athletic and keep myself in good shape. The day of the stroke, I had been to the
          gym that morning, lifted weights and then went for a short swim. I worked out like that three or
          four days a week, every week, for most of my life. I was in top shape, and I was tan. You’re
          never so tan as when you’re under ultra-white hospital sheets.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          And I’ll never forget this. One of the nurses was just passing through my intensive care room,
          picking something up when she glanced at me with the most interesting, odd expression and said,
          <span className="ital">What are you doing here?</span> She didn’t say it with a humorous expression or smile, she just said it.
          In my mind, I said something like, <span className="ital">Ahh, just taking some time off of work, thought I might get away for a while</span>. No, I didn’t say that.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I was fit and tan and she was genuinely surprised. It still seems odd to me, recalling that
          moment—I wonder if I’m misremembering it—she must have said it humorously and I just
          didn’t catch it. Intensive care after a major stroke isn’t the high water mark for one’s mental
          acuity.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          My entire life I had always slept like a baby. After the stroke, I became an insomniac, a terrible
          insomniac, lying there in my bed for months, often awake till the first light of dawn before my
          body forced me to sleep a couple of hours. The months became a year or more of not sleeping
          properly. My brain was so imprinted with the fear of never waking again—it didn’t let me sleep.
          It wasn’t my choice, it was my brain’s choice.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          As the weeks turned to months, the recovery was a slow process. Initially, walking, walking
          anywhere, my left leg felt like it was trying to walk through concrete and the heel of my left foot
          dragged behind. It’s a horrible feeling. Just walking down the hall was exhausting. I couldn’t
          walk up more than one flight of stairs. My strength was gone, just gone. It was scary to be that
          damaged. It was like my body couldn’t quite find the ON switch. It was going to be a while, a
          year or so, before I felt like me again.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I had to give myself shots in the stomach, twice a day for weeks. I was kept under strict watch
          and had to return to the hospital to have my levels checked every week for the next five or six
          months—every week. I was so lucky, luck again, to have been assigned the nurse who monitored
          me every step of the way. She knows who she is...<span className="ital">thank you.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I started working with a physical therapist and an occupational therapist. I had to learn how to
          walk normally again, how to pick things up and how to talk without a slur or stutter. For weeks, I
          couldn’t pick up a penny from the table, my hand was still blunted from having been paralyzed.
          My balance was off. The stutter, or a hesitation when I spoke was disconcerting, it was like my
          mouth was trying to catch up to what my brain had already said—I began to feel that there was a
          delay somewhere in the workings of my mind.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Inexplicably, my voice was a little bit higher. My PT explained that the voice box is a muscle and
          mine went off-line for a while—regaining my normal voice and tone were all a part of the
          process. I took it upon myself to start taking guitar and singing lessons. Making my left hand
          form chords and trying to sing jump-started my recovery and not long after that I started feeling
          more normal again.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It was a year later before I was cleared to slowly begin working out again. I was still so weak,
          like a child. It took months to get not all, but most of my strength back. And then another six
          months or so I finally, physically, felt like my old self again, strong and fit—lifting weights,
          swimming and yoga. My left heel would still catch the ground as I walked, as if the brain’s signal
          couldn’t make it all the way down to the messaging of my foot. The brain damage is something
          else altogether, not quantifiable in a simple, physical way.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I guess I saved the best for last. The highlight of my hospital adventure was an image I will take
          to my grave. On the day I was to be released, not one, but three doctors walked in and put the
          MRI scan of my brain up on the lightboard —all eyes on the picture of my brain. I felt like a lab
          rat. They were studying me, my brain, as if I were not laying there in my bed, staring at the same
          image.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          There were five or six little white dots in my brain. And nothing can prepare you for what the
          doctor said next, <span className="ital">Those white dots...that’s where there is no brain activity. Your brain will heal as
          best it can but brain damage is permanent. It will find ways around those areas, it will adapt, it
          will try to compensate—it’s called neuroplasticity. But those parts of your brain will never fully
          recover...</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It's called neuroplasticity, or brain plasticity, and is, quite literally a re-wiring of the brain’s
          damaged or dead spots. Forming new pathways. Strengthening existing ones. Compensating as
          best it can. There are only two ways I’ve come to understand and explain the experience of my
          brain and how the brain damage presents itself. The first is that of a turntable.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Imagine <span className="ital">you</span> are a turntable, a record player. Everything that makes you, <span className="ital">you</span>—you’re entire
          mental, physical, emotional, psychic existence is that of a turntable. Most of the time, the record
          is spinning at normal speed and playing the music that is your active human experience, <span className="ital">
          your normal day-to-day existence.</span> But sometimes, for just a moment, the needle lifts off the album—
          and you weren’t the one who lifted the needle. The record is still spinning, you’re still breathing
          and thinking and feeling, but for a micro-second your brain goes offline, just until the needle sets
          back down on the spinning record—and you return to you.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Within those micro moments of the needle being off the album, I’m not quite <span className="ital">me</span>. I hear myself
          say something and, it just doesn’t sound quite right, it doesn’t sound like the me I’ve always
          known, as me. When speaking, a word might get stuck, so that I have to think about the word,
          specifically, how to correctly pronounce the word. If I don’t, there’s a tiny almost imperceptible
          stutter or hesitation as my brain searches for the word and how to properly enunciate it.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It’s an odd experience that points to the unimaginable complexity of the mind and its inner
          workings. I suppose the writer in me is particularly tuned in to this word dynamic. The journey
          of the brain’s mysterious process, neuroplasticity, is a beautifully complex re-organization and
          re-wiring of the brain’s understanding of itself, and me.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          When the needle lifts off the album, I hear myself say or express something that sounds mostly
          compatible with whatever needs to be said—even if it’s not what I would have said or how I
          would have said it. For a moment, I am a facsimile... of me. I am what the brain <span className="ital">imagines</span> me to
          be based on a lifetime of being me, based on a lifetime of data that approximates what I would
          say in that space when the needle is off the album. It’s not unlike an AI experience, a grouping of
          historically familiar qualities, a likeness and a resemblance of self.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
        When it happens, it’s as if my brain, normally, a sprawling five-lane major interstate of activity is
suddenly forced onto a little one lane, dirt road. All the information, the input, the fuller
complexity of self, the whole of me doesn’t have anywhere to go. So, for the briefest moment,
<span className="ital">the self</span> fractures into jarred and broken pieces, broken pieces of thought and speech—like my
speech is trying to catch up, or jump the synaptic gap—<span className="ital">jump the dead space</span>.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It happens more around strangers. When I’m with family or friends, people who really know me,
          it rarely happens. It’s like my brain has so much accumulated history, so much bandwidth—the
          historical pathways in my mind with loved ones is so significant and established. It is, in fact,
          that the pathway of what is known, what is most often revistited, those pathways have enough
          bandwidth to accommodate whatever my brain is doing when the needle lifts.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          There’s a second way I’ve come to know and express the experience, and maybe this is more
          concise and visually descriptive. I was a general contractor, renovating homes and was working
          on a very old breaker panel in the basement of a house built in the 1860’s. On a brutally cold
          winter day in upstate New York, I flipped one of the breakers off and suddenly, the most eerie,
          almost liquid blue-white form of electricity rose out of the panel, as if in slow motion—briefly
          suspended. And then, just as suddenly it reached across the board two or three inches and
          returned to a different breaker. As if alive, really <span className="ital">alive</span>, it reconnected to its primary power, back
          from where it had originated—reconnecting itself to itself.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It was scary, you could actually see the electricity, you could see its power and almost magical
          ability to seemingly self-realize and move through space without guidance, without being
          confined by wires or breakers or anything, not accountable or restrained by its source, just...free.
          I’m...out there, somewhere, finding my way back...to me. The needle lifting off the spinning
          album and the arcing electricity is the best way I can describe the experience of my post-stroke
          mind. It’s like, in a very real sense, I’m not alone as one assumes they are alone with their own
          mind—mine seems to go elsewhere at times, all by itself.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          These brief moments, my brain finds itself on a road that has ended (dead) or is still under
          construction. (healing) My brain then jumps the synaptic gap to where the road starts again—<span className="ital">
          or where the road should be</span>. But in that jump, something is lost, something isn’t quite there—me.
          For a moment, I am some sort of amalgamation of what my brain conjures—like a momentarily
          relative version of me.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Even as I type this, I can’t believe I’m going to put this up on the website...I’m still not sure I
          will. 
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I have no idea where my stories, my books come from, none whatsoever. And what eventually
          became <span className="ital">Daisy and the Dream Defenders</span> is a mystery unto itself. But laying there in the hospital,
          recovering from the stroke, there was something about the ambulance ride that resonated, it
          stuck—and it didn’t go away.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          A few months later, still in the middle of a long recovery, I wasn’t writing, I was struggling and I
          was alone. I’m a horrible drawer or sketcher or whatever it’s called but on a whim, maybe just to
          prompt some writing again, or prompt anything, I bought an artist notebook and a pack of
          colored markers. There had been something <span className="ital">there</span> within my mind for months since the stroke,
          something that did not yet have words—was only an outer most peripheral sensibility.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The first thing I drew with red and orange magic markers was an space-ambulance with a big
          rocket engine racing through deep space. To where or from where..? No idea. But I drew it over
          and over, until eventually...a dream hospital? And then a very rough sketch of what became the
          character Daisy, someone who would always be there for kids feeling alone or scared, someone
          who would always have their back, defending them...<span className="ital">every kid deserves a Daisy.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It's strange being a writer and writing about this, And I hear myself thinking, almost disbelieving
          my own experience, still unable to fully grasp it... <span className="ital">Did that really happen? Did I almost die?</span>
          Yes... yes I did. Somewhere down deep in my inability to fully comprehend how close I was to
          no longer being here, it almost feels like fiction, but it’s not—it only reads that way.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          For many reasons, mostly pertaining to how vulnerable and exposed it makes me feel—I thought
          not to share any of this. Emotionally, it’s been heavy and hard to recall it in such detail, to put it
          all down on paper. It resurfaces a depth of feeling I will never entirely be able to express. It’s a
          strange sadness, like I’m mourning myself, mourning the man I almost wasn’t...
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
        But the stroke opened up and revealed something good and wonderful, something hopeful and
shining with gratitude, something that reminds me every day to keep taking risks, keep working
toward my goals. It’s a daunting task to build a production company from scratch with no
resources or funding, but I’ve faced and overcome much more daunting tasks in my life—and
there is <span className="ital">no more time to not do what I have to do.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
        They say live every day like it’s your last...<span className="ital">they’re right.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I’ve said it elsewhere in these homepages, I’ve said it in different ways, that what I want to
          build—is something more than just another production company, something more than books and
          movies, something I still don’t quite have the words for, something almost communal, something
          shared. Honestly, without having had the stroke and all it entailed, I don’t think I would have
          ever even considered a production company and my vision for <span className="ital">eaglefire</span>—one was born of the other.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          To this day, when I think of it all—the stroke, the hospital and everything that followed—I think
          of that last evening in the hospital, looking at my brain scan, looking at the five or six white dots
          of lifeless brain areas. I imagined then, and envision now, the most beautiful butterflies slowly
          emerging from the dark, dead spots of my brain, emerging from the soft, delicate cocoons of
          those five or six white dots—slowly spreading their wings and flying out.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I didn’t know it then, but that’s where, that night, that moment...<span className="ital">eaglefire</span> took flight.
